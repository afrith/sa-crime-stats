sa-crime-stats
==============

This repository contains South African crime statistics for the period 2003 to
2013, reformatted into a format that is much easier to use than the spreadsheet
provided by the SAPS. Also present is the Python script used to perform this
reformatting.

The source spreadsheet was downloaded from http://www.saps.gov.za/resource_centre/publications/statistics/crimestats/2013/downloads/police_station_figures_per_province.xls

The script `reformat.py` is licensed under the MIT License.
